# Sign Language to Text Translation Using Artificial Intelligence
This project explores the creation of an artificial intelligence (AI) system designed to translate American Sign Language (ASL) into text. Developed by Núria Llopart as her final high school research project in 2020, this work demonstrates the potential of AI to enhance accessibility and communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing communities.

### Overview
The project's main goal is to design and implement a neural network capable of identifying and translating the ASL alphabet. The process includes:

1. Introducing AI concepts and their relevance to image classification tasks.
2. Explaining the role of technologies like Python and TensorFlow in AI development.
3. Step-by-step guidance through the model's design, training, and evaluation.

# Key Features
- AI-Driven Translation: Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image processing and classification.
- Python and TensorFlow Integration: Leverages state-of-the-art tools for machine learning and deep learning.
- Scalable Approach: The methodology can be adapted for more complex sign language systems in the future.
  
# Awards and Recognition
This project has been recognized for its innovation and impact, earning several prestigious awards:
